# üè° House Price Prediction Model

This project is a Machine Learning-based House Price Prediction Model developed to estimate property prices based on multiple housing features. The model uses a dataset containing variables such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and more. The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict house prices for future data.

The entire pipeline includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables), exploratory data analysis (EDA) for visualizing feature relationships, feature selection, and model training using algorithms like Linear Regression or other suitable regressors. Performance evaluation is done using metrics such as R¬≤ score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

This project is ideal for those looking to understand the application of supervised learning in real estate and can be extended into a web application or integrated with real-time pricing APIs for practical use. It was built using Python, with libraries including pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
